            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Sonne of God, the ſupreame wiſdome of the Father, ſetting vp his diuine concluſions, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as it were) the greateſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of all the worlde, to enter in diſpute againſt them, ſaith.
<hi>Doe men gather grapes of Thornes, or Figges of thistles?</hi> What ſhall we ſay to this demande? Muſt it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be granted, and can it no way be denied? Surely yes, me thinkes it may. Firſt therfore I ſay (with my Lord and maſters leaue) that<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13903:3"/>he himſelfe being perfect man, doth gather from many ſinful men ſonnes and daughters, of whom he maketh glorious Saints: but this is to gather grapes of Thornes, ergo. Secondly, who may better helpe me to maintaine this aſſertion, (Madam) then your ſelfe? For from whence hath he gathered your ſelfe (ſo worthie a grape) but of a Thorne? A grape ſo rare (albeit gathered of a very Thorne) that hauing bene preſſed by him in his ſacred preſſe, hath yelded ſuch ſtore &amp; plentie of pretious liquor, as hath not only filled his houſe with the odor therof, but hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindled and enflamed, yea plainly inebriated the harts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cold ones in his burning loue.</p>
            <p>The preſſe wherin this Lord doth preſſe ſuch pretious grapes,<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13903:3"/>as your ſelfe, what other is it then the preſſor of perſecution. The pretious iuyce which is preſſed out of theſe excellent grapes, are thoſe moſt pretious and excellent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtues, which manifeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues amidſt perſecutions. The glorious Apoſtle S. Paul, deſirous to giue vnto vs, a proofe and taſt of that pretious liquor which was preſſed out of him ſelfe, after his conuerſion to the faith of Chriſt, ſaith. <hi>Vntill this houre, we doe both hungar and thirst, and are naked, &amp; are beaten with buffets, and are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and labor working with our ovvne handes.</hi> And which is there of all theſe, that you may not truly ſay as well as he? Verely it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, that God would in ſome ſort, paragonize you Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp, with this glorious Apoſtle,<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13903:4"/>and make you a ſpectacle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patterne to women, as he was to men, in eache of theſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perſecutions.</p>
            <p>Firſt therfore, in hungar and thirſt as well as he, hauing bene reduced to that extremitie, as to be forced to ſend to the Spaniſh and Venetian Embaſſadors to beg your bread: and on Fridayes and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, to be taxed to the allowance of three pence a day, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your ſelfe, your man, &amp; your maide. In nakednes as well as he, as being not only deſpoiled of your plate, ie wells, and rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, but alſo to be ſtript ſo nere, euen of neceſſaries, as to be forced to ſet in your chamber in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſleeues, not able to goe out of doores, for lack of clothes. In being beaten with buffets as well as he,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13903:4"/>pittifully ſwollen with black and blue, yea trailed by the haire of the head, and trodden vnder foote: treatment truly fitter for a dog, then for a Chriſtian Lady: which yet for the loue you ſtill beare to your abuſer, I ommit to enlarge. In wandring as well as he; who haue bene forced to trauell many miles (not in the day time, and in your Coache, as your cuſtome was, and your ranck requireth) but on foot, in the dead of the night, and to fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In labor and working with your own handes to get your liuing: wherof many gentlemen of worth can yet beare witnes, who coming to viſit you in that poore eſtate, found you <pb n="8" facs="tcp:13903:5"/>labouring with your handes to get your liuinge.</p>
            <p>But to ſay in a word with what incredible patience and inward confort you ſuſtained and ſuffered the preſſures aforſaid, let this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for an euerlaſting memory, that to as many of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as you met with all, with great pleaſure and contentment you ſaid, that you could tell them great good newes, to wit, that you were now no more a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but were become a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique; Which you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to all with ſuch alacritie of minde, that many who heard you, deemed you mad for making that anſwer; like as the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for their enflamed feruor in the faith of Chriſt, were eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med drunke. But o happie foode<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13903:5"/>which cauſeth ſuch a happie fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie! And o happie drinke, which ſo makes drunke<hi>!</hi>

            <p>I neede not (Madam) the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes conſidered, frame any apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for my ſelfe in this place, why I made choiſe of your Lady-ſhip, to protect and patronize this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treatiſe, intituled,

Ioannes Niderus writeth, to haue knowen a gentleman of note, named Sucher, who whilſt he kept in a caſtle<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13903:125"/>nighe the towne of Halle in Germany, as he grew cold in the ſeruice of God, nor frequenting the Sacraments as he was wonte, becauſe of the quarrells which he had againſt thoſe of Halle, went and fild his caſtle with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of lewed ſeruants, all trained vp in warres, and enured to their weapons: the diuell (diſguiſed like a ſoldiar) came alſo to preſent and offer his ſeruice to him. This couetous gentleman, ſeeing that this ſoldiar offred to ſerue him without any wages, he accepted of him, and made him his horſe-keeper. The deuil began from that time, to ſerue his maſter with all fidellitie, but it was obſerued after a longe while, that he neuer went vnto the Church, conducting his maſter only vnto the doore, &amp; then returning to his worke.</p>
                     <p>The gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> although deſbauched, yet ſtill continued his good cuſtome, now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare Maſſe, &amp; we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to bed, nor yet aroſe, but firſt be made the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſaid ſome certaine<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13903:126"/>Aue Maries. And hauing bene could and obſeruing him ſelfe, that his horſe-keeper neuer went to Church, he vrged him vpon a day, to tell him freely who he was. The horſ-keeper tould him, that he was the deuill, but bid him for all this, not to haue any apprehention, ſithe he had ſtill til then found him faithfull, and ſhould ſtill finde him more and more from that time forward. The gentleman was at the firſt a litle afraid, notwithſtanding, moued with couetouſnes, reſolued to keepe him yet a while.</p>
                     <p>One night as he ſlept, behould this diuell horſe-keeper, awaked him with a ſodaine ſtarting, crying. Maſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13903:126"/>him ſelfe to make, the ſigne of the Croſſe, and to ſay his prayers he was wont to ſay. Being vp, and ready, he looked forth at all the windoes, and ſaw nothinge, whence he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that this was nothing but a falſe alarum: and all in cholar, asked of his deuill, what had moued him, ſo to trouble and moleſt him, in the midſt of his ſleepe. The diuell a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered him, that he had done it for this deſigne, thinking that the affrithtment and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine haſte to get him vp, would haue made him forgot the making of the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſaying of his prayers, and by this meanes he would haue ſet vpon him. The gentlma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, was euer after much more dilligent in this his dutie then he was before, but he could not for all this be quit of this deueliſh ſeruant, vntill ſuch time as he began to frequent the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: for the very firſt time whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin he had recourſe vnto them, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vaniſhed quite away, and he neuer<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13903:127"/>ſaw him afterwardes. <hi>Niderus l. 3. form.</hi>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13903:140"/>date. In the yeare 1609. at Limoges in Guienna, a Baker that had good ſtore of cuſtomers, was much enuyed of an old witche, which entring into his houſe, charmed the ouen and the dowe, mumbling out certaine barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wordes and vnknowen. She was forthwith taken with the fact, but they did naught, ſaue only laugh a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle therat; vntill that on the morrow morning, the Baker coming to looke vpon his paſt, which he had made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the day before, founde that it was all ſpoiled and plainly ſtunke. The like happened vnto him the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, and the third day alſo, ſo that he founde him ſelfe in great neceſſitie, and ſo perplexed, that wanting mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to pay his creditors, and forced to goe beg his bread, he was vpon the point to forſake his houſe, and to goe like a vagabond about the contrie.</p>
                     <p>But before he put in practiſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, he went and recounted his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to a father of the Societie of<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13903:140"/>Ieſus, who counſelled him to confes him ſelfe with al his familie, and made him to promiſe, to doe the like from that time forward, once a monthe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they were all confeſt, he gaue to ether of them an Agnus Dei, and a litle botle full of holy water, enioining the Baker to ſprinckle his paſte there with euery day.</p>
                     <p>He did as he was wild, and at the firſt ſprinckling (a ſtrange caſe) he ſaw iſſue forth of his dowe, a ſtinkinge va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, which cauſed a trembling tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all his bodie, but bleſſing him ſelfe with the ſigne of the Croſſe, it vaniſhed away, and he found his dow or paſt all changed, and the loaues wel come. He continued the ſame a whole yeare with the like ſucceſſe, but at the laſt quite neglected this good cuſtome, to ſprincle his paſte with holy water: and behould preſently, the aforeſaid witch-craft began againe, and for a month together he found his paſte all corrupted, al black and ſo ſtinking, that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13903:141"/>none durſt come nere vnto it, nor would the very dogges ſo much as eate it. Wherupon he ſprinckled it againe, and behould he was preſentlie ſeazed with ſo great a feare, that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to cary him to his bed; but this paſt within a while, &amp; on the morrow he found his dowe both faire and good, and his batch of bread came paſſing well.
